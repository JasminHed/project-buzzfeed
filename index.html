    <i>Work with a view—just like Selma Lagerlöf once did</i>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Perched on a hill in Bredäng with a stunning view over Lake Mälaren, Konditori Lyran isn’t just a café—it’s a piece
    of Swedish literary history. In the late 1800s, the villa was a cultural hotspot where authors, musicians, and
    artists gathered for lively soirées hosted by Fredrika and Carl Limnell. Selma Lagerlöf, Henrik Ibsen, and even King
    Oscar II were among the guests, and it’s said that the Swedish expression “att vara på lyran” (meaning to be tipsy)
    originates from these legendary gatherings. </p>
  <p>
    Aside from its rich history, Konditori Lyran is a great workspace. With spacious indoor seating, peaceful
    surroundings, and a breathtaking outdoor terrace, it’s an inspiring spot to focus or collaborate. Their classic
    Swedish fika, featuring homemade cakes and pastries, makes for an excellent work break.
    Beware, though—weekends can get quite crowded, and the peaceful atmosphere quickly turns into a lively buzz..</p>
